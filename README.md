## Pros and Cons of TDD

#### Pros: 
- Encourages only writing code that is neccessary.
- Increased modularity of design.
- More maintable design because only working on small testable features, independent of others.
- Easier refactoring.
- Testing every facet.
- Self-documentation.
- Less debugging work overall.
#### Cons:
- Bad tests can happen in a bad design.
- Takes longer to create the product due to writing test code, before code code.
- If not everyone is doing TDD then there is no point in doing TDD as you lose out on its benefits.
- Need to update tests when updating requirements/scope.
